# Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) Analysis of Star Wars Movie Scripts

![Star Wars](star-wars-image-link)

## Introduction
This repository contains an exploration of the Star Wars Original Trilogy movie scripts using text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The main objectives of this analysis are to gain insights into the dialogues, characters, and sentiments of the iconic movies. The analysis is based on a Kaggle competition that was created to celebrate Star Wars Day on May 4th.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of script dialogues from the first three movies of the Star Wars franchise (Episodes 4-6), collectively known as The Original Trilogy. These dialogues provide a rich text source for various NLP tasks.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Understanding NLP Basics
Before diving into the analysis, we'll provide an overview of natural language processing (NLP) concepts to lay the foundation for the subsequent tasks.

### 2. Frequency Distribution Analysis
We will analyze the frequency distribution of words within The Original Trilogy scripts to identify the most commonly used words.

### 3. Frequency Distribution Plot
A frequency distribution plot will be created to visually represent the most frequently used words in The Original Trilogy.

### 4. Text Pre-processing with NLTK
To prepare the dataset for more in-depth analysis, we will perform text-mining operations using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. This step includes tasks such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming.

### 5. Revised Frequency Distribution
After pre-processing the text, we will reanalyze the frequency distribution of words to observe how the distribution has changed.

### 6. Word Clouds for Characters
We will create Word Clouds to visually depict the most used words associated with two iconic characters: Darth Vader and Yoda.

### 7. TF-IDF Model for Keyword Identification
The Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model will be employed to identify the most relevant words within The Original Trilogy scripts.

### 8. Sentiment Analysis
To gauge the overall sentiment of the trilogy, we will perform sentiment analysis on the movie scripts using appropriate NLP tools and techniques.


## Conclusion
By conducting text mining and NLP analysis on the Star Wars Original Trilogy scripts, we aim to uncover intriguing insights about the characters, dialogues, and sentiments embedded within these iconic movies. Feel free to explore the results and adapt the analysis for your own text-based projects!

May the force be with you!
